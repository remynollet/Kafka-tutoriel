# Kafka-tutoriel
My personal Kafka testing repository  

## simple-kafka-asyncapi

Create a first folder to validate a docker infra with Kafka, console and microcks  
Create a validated asyncapi file that describe a kafka endpoint  
Mock a kafka producer with Microcks.  

## splitted-kafka-asyncapi

Create an other folder to work on a splitted asyncapi file.

The asyncapi may have a $ref to the ce-cloud headers and a $ref to the avro schema files.
We may also create many "samples" to be link as example.

## create the asynapi server part from the infra as code or the provider api.
